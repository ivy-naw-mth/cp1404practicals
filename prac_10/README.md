# Reflection

1. Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject? What did you learn from doing the estimates?

    * I got better at estimating how long it takes to write Python codes by paying closer attention and making fewer mistakes. Now, I'm more careful about repeating structures and keeping each part of the code focused on one job. This helped me notice errors more often and stick to coding rules, making tasks seem less tricky as I learned more.

2. Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

    * Learning to prioritize tasks and simplify code without repetition has helped me analyze others' code better and discover alternative solutions. Code reviews have been really useful and helpful in improving my coding skills; receiving feedback from classmates helps me understand what works and what needs fixing. Additionally, reviewing others' code has exposed me to different coding approaches and emphasized the importance of clear commenting for easier understanding during reviews.

3. Regarding practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject? 

    * If I were in charge of this subject, I'd introduce group presentations to provide valuable experiences and diversity of the projects to showcase Python's applications across various domains. Exploring Kivy further could enhance our understanding of its capabilities, while reflecting on common mistakes weekly can help all students refine their work based on feedback. While keeping practical tasks mostly unchanged, I'd suggest adding outputs to clarify topics and include solutions to aid understanding and problem-solving.
